## 1. Introduction
This test plan defines the QA strategy for testing the **Saleor Demo Storefront** application and its associated GraphQL API.  
The objective is to ensure functional correctness, performance, accessibility, and user experience quality across web and mobile environments.

---

## 2. Scope
### In-Scope:
- User Registration and Authentication  
- Product Search  
- Add/Remove Items from Cart  
- Checkout Flow  
- GraphQL API validation for products and cart  

### Out of Scope:
- Payment gateway integration (simulated, not real)  
- Third-party plugins  

---

## 3. Objectives
- Verify **core functionality** of the Saleor Storefront  
- Validate **API responses** against expected schema  
- Measure **performance** under load conditions  
- Ensure **accessibility compliance** with WCAG guidelines  

---

## 4. Test Strategy
### Manual Testing:
- Exploratory and scenario-based testing  
- Functional flows: registration, search, add-to-cart, checkout  

### Automated Testing:
- **Cypress E2E**: login, search, checkout  
- **Cross-browser**: Chrome, Firefox  
- **Mobile responsive**: iPhone, Pixel viewports  
- **API tests**: GraphQL queries validation  
- **Accessibility**: Axe plugin  
- **Performance**: Lighthouse scores  

---

## 5. Test Environments
- **Web:** Desktop + Mobile (Chrome, Firefox)  
- **Mobile:** iPhone 12, Pixel 5 (simulated in Cypress)  
- **API:** Saleor GraphQL endpoint ‚Äì [https://demo.saleor.io/graphql/](https://demo.saleor.io/graphql/)  

---

## 6. Tools
- **Test Management:** Jira (defect logging & tracking)  
- **Automation:** Cypress  
- **Accessibility:** Axe plugin  
- **Performance:** Lighthouse plugin  
- **Reporting:** Cypress Dashboard (if available)

## 7. Test Cases (High-Level)
| ID  | Test Case Description | Expected Result | Type |
|-----|----------------------|-----------------|------|
| TC01 | User Registration with valid data | Account created successfully | Manual |
| TC02 | Login with valid credentials | User redirected to dashboard | Manual |
| TC03 | Search for product | Correct product list displayed | Manual + Automated |
| TC04 | Add/Remove product from cart | Cart updates correctly | Manual + Automated |
| TC05 | Checkout flow with sample data | Order placed successfully | Automated |
| TC06 | GraphQL product query | API returns valid schema | Automated |
| TC07 | Accessibility check on homepage | No critical Axe violations | Automated |
| TC08 | Lighthouse performance audit | Score ‚â• 80 on key pages | Automated |

## 8. Deliverables
- `manual-testing/TestCases_Web.md` ‚Äì Test cases (web)  
- `manual-testing/TestCases_Mobile.md` ‚Äì Test cases (mobile)  
- `manual-testing/TestResults.md` ‚Äì Results of manual execution  
- `cypress/e2e/*.cy.js` ‚Äì Automated test scripts  
- `jira/defects.md` ‚Äì Defects log  

---

## 9. Exit Criteria
- All **critical defects resolved**  
- 90%+ **test case pass rate**  
- Performance scores meet benchmarks  
- Accessibility violations remediated  

---

## 10. Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** API downtime may block test execution  
  - **Mitigation:** Mock responses for critical flows  
- **Risk:** Cross-browser inconsistencies  
  - **Mitigation:** Include at least 2 browsers (Chrome + Firefox)
